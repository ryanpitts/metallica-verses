# Hit The Lights
No life till leather. We are gonna kick some ass tonight.
We got the metal madness.
When our fans start screaming, it's right. Well, alright.
When we start to rock, we never want to stop again.
Hit the lights, hit the lights, hit the lights.
You know our fans are insane.
We are gonna blow this place away with volume higher than anything today, the only way.
With all our screaming, we are gonna rip right through your brain
We got the lethal power, it is causing you sweet pain. Oh sweet pain.

# The Four Horsemen
By the last breath of the fourth winds blow, better raise your ears.
The sound of hooves knocks at your door, lock up your wife and children now.
It's time to wield the blade, for now you have got some company.
The Horsemen are drawing nearer. On leather steeds they ride.
They have come to take your life.
On through the dead of night with the Four Horsemen ride, or choose your fate and die.
You have been dying since the day you were born. You know it has all been planned.
The quartet of deliverance rides.
A sinner once a sinner twice, no need for confession now.
Cause now you have got the fight of your life.
Time has taken its toll on you, the lines that crack your face.
Famine, your body it has torn through, withered in every place.
Pestilence for what you have had to endure and what you have put others through.
Death. Deliverance for you, for sure. Now there is nothing you can do.
So gather round young warriors now and saddle up your steeds.
Killing scores with demon swords. Now is the death of doers of wrong.
Swing the judgment hammer down, safely inside armor, blood guts and sweat.

# Motorbreath
Living and dying, laughing and crying.
Once you have seen it you will never be the same.
Life in the fast lane is just how it seems: Hard. And it's heavy, it's dirty and mean.
Motorbreath, it's how I live my life. I can't take it any other way.
Motorbreath, the sign of living fast. It is going to take your breath away.
Don't stop for nothing, it's full speed or nothing.
I am taking down you know whatever is in my way.
Getting your kicks as you are shooting the line, sending the shivers up and down your spine.
Those people who tell you not to take chances, they are all missing on what life is about.
You only live once so take hold of the chance.
Don't end up like others, the same song and dance.

# Jump In The Fire
Down in the depths of my fiery home the summons bell will chime.
Tempting you and all the earth to join our sinful kind.
There is a job to be done and I'm the one. You people make me do it.
Now it is time for your fate, and I won't hesitate to pull you down into this pit.
So come on, jump in the fire.
With hell in my eyes and with death in my veins, the end is closing in.
Feeding on the minds of man and from their souls within.
My disciples all shout to search out, and they always shall obey.
Follow me now my child not the meek or the mild, but do just as I say.
Jump by your will or be taken by force, I'll get you either way.
Trying to keep the hellfire lit, I am stalking you as prey.
Living your life as me, I am you, you see. There is part of me in everyone.
So reach down, grab my hand, walk with me through the land.
Come home where you belong.

# Whiplash
Late at night all systems go. You have come to see the show.
We do our best. You're the rest. You make it real, you know.
There is a feeling deep inside that drives you fuckin' mad. A feeling of a hammerhead.
You need it, oh, so bad. Adrenaline starts to flow.
You're thrashing all around, acting like a maniac. Whiplash.
Bang your head against the stage like you never did before.
Make it ring, make it bleed, make it really sore.
In a frenzied madness with your leather and your spikes, heads are bobbing all around.
It is hot as hell tonight.
Here on the stage the Marshal noise is piercing through your ears.
It kicks your ass, kick your face. Exploding feeling nears.
Now is the time to let it rip, to let it fuckin' loose.
We are gathered here to be with you cause this is what we choose.
The show is through, the metal is gone. It is time to hit the road.
Another town, another gig. Again we will explode.
Hotel rooms and motorways, life out here is raw.
But we will never stop. We will never quit. Cause we are Metallica.

# Phantom Lord
Sound is ripping through your ears, the deafening sound of metal nears.
Your bodies waiting for his whips. The taste of leather on your lips.
Hear the cry of War louder than before.
With his sword in hand to control the land, crushing metal strikes.
On this frightening night, fall onto your knees for the Phantom Lord.
Victims falling under chains, you hear them crying dying pains.
The fists of terrors breaking through, now there's nothing you can do.
The leather armies have prevailed. The Phantom Lord has never failed.
Smoke is lifting from the ground, the rising volume, metal sound.
Fall to your knees and bow to the Phantom Lord.

# No Remorse
No mercy for what we are doing, no thought to even what we have done.
We don't need to feel the sorrow, no remorse for the helpless one.
War without end, no remorse, no repent.
We don't care what it meant: another day, another death.
Another sorrow, another breath. No remorse, no repent.
Blood feeds the war machine as it eats its way across the land.
We don't need to feel the sorrow. No remorse is the one command.
Only the strong survive, no one to save the weaker race.
We are ready to kill all comers, like a loaded gun right at your face.
Attack. Bullets are flying, people are dying.
With madness surrounding, all hell's breaking loose.
Soldiers are hounding, bodies are mounting, cannons are shouting to take their abuse.
With war machines going, blood starts to flowing. No mercy given to anyone here.
The furious fighting, swords are like lighting.
It all becomes frightening to you. Know death is near, no remorse.

# Seek & Destroy
We are scanning the scene in the city tonight.
We are looking for you to start up a fight.
There is an evil feeling in our brains, but it is nothing new. You know it drives us insane.
Running, on our way. Hiding, you will pay. Dying one thousand deaths.
Searching, seek and destroy. There is no escape, and that is for sure.
This is the end we won't take any more: Say goodbye to the world you live in.
You have always been taking, but now you're giving.
Our brains are on fire with the feeling to kill.
And it won't go away until our dreams are fulfilled.
There is only one thing on our minds.
Don't try running away, `cause you're the one we will find.

# Metal Militia
Thunder and lightning, the gods take revenge. Senseless destruction.
Victims of fury are cowardly now, running for safety.
Stabbing the harlot to pay for her sins, leaving the virgin.
Suicide running as if it were free, ripping and tearing.
On through the mist and the madness, we are trying to get the message to you.
Metal militia, chained and shadowed to be left behind. Nine and one thousand.
Metal militia for your sacrifice, iron-clad soldiers.
Join or be conquered, the law of the land.
What will befall you? The metallization of your inner soul. Twisting and turning.
We are as one as we all are the same, fighting for one cause.
Leather and metal are our uniforms, protecting what we are.
Joining together to take on the world with our heavy metal.
Spreading the message to everyone here, come let yourself go.

# Fight Fire With Fire
Do unto others as they have done unto you.
But what in the hell is this world coming to?
Blow the universe into nothingness. Nuclear warfare shall lay us to rest.
Fight fire with fire. Ending is near.
Fight fire with fire. Bursting with fear.
We all shall die. Time is like a fuse, short and burning fast.
Armageddon is here, like said in the past.
Soon to fill our lungs, the hot winds of death.
The gods are laughing, so take your last breath.

# Ride The Lightning
Guilty as charged. But damn it, it ain't right: There is someone else controlling me.
Death in the air, strapped in the electric chair. This can't be happening to me.
Who made you God, to say, "I'll take your life from you!"
Flash before my eyes, now it's time to die.
Burning in my brain, I can feel the flames. Wait for the sign to flick the switch of death.
It's the beginning of the end. Sweat, chilling cold as I watch death unfold.
Consciousness my only friend, my fingers grip with fear. What I am doing here?
Someone help me. Oh please God help me.
They are trying to take it all away. I don't want to die.
Time moving slowly, the minutes seem like hours. The final curtain call I see.
How true is this? Just get it over with. If this is true, just let it be.
Wakened by the horrid scream, freed from the frightening dream.

# For Whom The Bell Tolls
Make his fight on the hill in the early day, constant chill deep inside.
Shouting gun, on they run through the endless grey.
On they fight, for the right. Yes, but who's to say?
For a hill men would kill. Why? They do not know.
Stiffened wounds test their pride. Men of five, still alive through the raging glow.
Gone insane from this pain that they surely know.
For whom the bell tolls, time marches on.
Take a look to the sky just before you die, it is the last time you will.
Blackened roar, massive roar fills the crumbling sky.
Shattered goal fills his soul with a ruthless cry.
Stranger now are his eyes to this mystery. He hears the silence so loud.
Crack of dawn, all is gone except the will to be.
Now they will see what will be, blinded eyes to see.

# Fade To Black
Life it seems, will fade away, drifting further every day.
Getting lost within myself, nothing matters. No one else.
I have lost the will to live, simply nothing more to give.
There is nothing more for me. Need the end to set me free
Things are not what they used to be, missing one inside of me.
Deathly lost, this can't be real. Cannot stand this hell I feel.
Emptiness is filing me to the point of agony.
Growing darkness, taking dawn. I was me, but now He's gone.
No one but me can save myself, but it's too late.
Now I can't think. Think, why I should even try?
Yesterday seems as though it never existed.
Death greets me warm. Now I will just say goodbye.

# Trapped Under Ice
I don't know how to live trough this hell.
Woken up, I'm still locked in this shell.
Frozen soul, frozen down to the core. Break the ice, I can't take anymore.
Freezing, can't move at all, screaming. Can't hear my call.
I am dying to live, cry out! I'm trapped under the ice
Crystallized. As I lay here and rest, eyes of glass stare directly at death.
From deep sleep I have broken away. No one knows. No one hears what I say.
Scream from my soul: Fate, mystified.
Hell, forever more no release from my cryonic state.
What is this? I've been stricken by fate, wrapped up tight.
Cannot move, can't break free. Hand of doom has a tight grip on me.

# Escape
Feel no pain, but my life ain't easy. I know I'm my best friend.
No one cares, but I'm so much stronger. I'll fight until the end.
To escape from the true false world: undamaged destiny.
Can't get caught in the endless circle: ring of stupidity.
Out of my own, out to be free, one with my mind. They just can't see.
No need to hear things that they say.
Life is for my own to live my own way.
Rape my mind and destroy my feelings, don't tell my what to do.
I don't care now, 'cause I'm on my side and I can see through you.
Feed my brain with your so-called standards, who says that I ain't right?
Break away from your common fashion, see through your blurry sight.
See, they try to bring the hammer down.
No damn chains can hold me to the ground, life is for my own to live my own way.

# Creeping Death
Slaves: Hebrews born to serve, to the pharaoh.
Heed to his every word, live in fear.
Faith of the unknown one, the deliverer.
Wait. Something must be done, four hundred years.
So let it be written, so let it be done. I'm sent here by the chosen one
So let it be written, so let it be done. To kill the firstborn pharaoh son.
I'm creeping death.
Now let my people go, land of Goshen.
Go. I will be with thee, bush of fire.
Blood running red and strong, down the Nile.
Plague, darkness three days long. Hail to fire.
Die by my hand. I creep across the land, killing firstborn man.
I rule the midnight air, the destroyer.
Born, I shall soon be there, deadly mass.
I creep the steps and flood final darkness.
Blood. Lambs' blood, painted door, I shall pass.

# Battery
Lashing out the action, returning the reaction, weak are ripped and torn away.
Hypnotizing power, crushing all that cower. Battery is here to stay.
Smashing through the boundaries, lunacy has found me. Cannot stop the Battery.
Pounding out aggression turns into obsession. Cannot kill the Battery.
Cannot kill the family. Battery is found in me.
Crushing all deceivers, mashing non-believers: never-ending potency.
Hungry violence-seeker, feeding off the weaker, breeding on insanity.
Circle of Destruction, Hammer comes crushing.
Powerhouse of energy whipping up a fury, dominating flurry.
We create the Battery.

# Master Of Puppets
End of passion play crumbling away, I'm your source of self-destruction.
Veins that pump with fear, sucking dark is clear.
Leading on your death's construction.
Taste me, you will see!
More is all you need, dedicated to how I'm killing you
Come crawling faster.
Obey your Master, your life burns faster.
Master of Puppets, I'm pulling your strings, twisting your mind and smashing your dreams.
Blinded by me, you can't see a thing.
Just call my name, 'cause I'll hear you scream: Master, master.
Needlework the way, never you betray. Life of death becoming clearer.
Pain monopoly, ritual misery. Chop your breakfast on a mirror
Master! Master! Where's the dreams that I've been after?
Master! Master, you promised only lies.
Laughter. Laughter. All I hear or see is laughter.
Laughter. Laughter, laughing at my cries.
Hell is worth all that: natural habitat, just a rhyme without a reason.
Neverending maze, drift on numbered days. Now your life is out of season.
I will occupy. I will help you die. I will run through you.
Now I rule you, too.

# The Thing That Should Not Be
Messenger of Fear in sight, dark deception kills the light.
Hybrid children watch the sea. Pray for Father, roaming free.
Fearless wretch: Insanity. He watches, lurking beneath the sea.
Great Old One: Forbidden site He searches. Hunter of the Shadows is rising.
Immortal, in madness You dwell.
Crawling Chaos, underground. Cult has summoned, twisted sound.
Out from ruins once possessed: Fallen city, living death.
Timeless sleep has been upset; He awakens.
Not dead, which eternal lie. Stranger eons, Death may die
Drain you of your sanity: Face the Thing that Should Not Be!

# Welcome Home (Sanitarium)
Welcome to where time stands still, no one leaves and no one will.
Moon is full, never seems to change. Just labeled mentally deranged
Dream the same thing every night, I see our freedom in my sight.
No locked doors, no windows barred, no things to make my brain seem scarred.
Sleep my friend and you will see: That dream is my reality.
They keep me locked up in this cage. Can't they see, it's why my brain says, "Rage!"
Sanitarium, leave me be. Sanitarium, just leave me alone.
Build my fear of what's out there, and cannot breathe the open air.
Whisper things into my brain.
Assuring me that I'm insane, they think our heads are in their hands.
But violent use brings violent plans.
Keep him tied, it makes him well. He's getting better, can't you tell?
No more can they keep us in. Listen, damn it, we will win.
They see it right, they see it well, but they think this saves us from our hell.
Fear of living on, natives getting restless now. Mutiny in the air.
Got some death to do.
Mirror stares back hard: Kill, it's such a friendly word.
Seems the only way for reaching out again.

# Disposable Heroes
Bodies fill the fields I see, hungry heroes end.
No one to play soldier now, no one to pretend.
Running blind through killing fields, bred to kill them all
Victim of what said should be, a servant till I fall.
Soldier boy, made of clay: Now an empty shell.
Twenty-one. Only son, but he served us well.
Bred to kill, not to care. Just do as we say.
Finished here, Greeting Death: He's yours to take away.
Back to the front! You will do what I say, when I say.
Back to the front! You will die when I say. You must die.
Back to the front! You coward, you servant, you blind man.
Barking of machine-gun fire does nothing to me now.
Sounding of the clock that ticks, get used to it somehow.
More a man, more stripes you wear, glory-seeker trends.
Bodies fill the fields I see, the slaughter never ends.
Why am I dying?
Kill! Have no fear. Lie! Live off lying. Hell! Hell is here.
I was born for dying.
Life planned out before my birth, nothing could I say.
Had no chance to see myself, molded day by day.
Looking back I realize, nothing have I done.
Left to die with only friend, alone I clench my gun.

# Leper Messiah
Spineless from the start, sucked into the part.
Circus comes to town, you play the lead clown.
Please, please, spreading his disease, living by his story.
Knees, knees, falling to your knees, suffer for his glory. You will.
Time for lust, time for lie, time to kiss your life goodbye.
Send me money, send me green: Heaven you will meet.
Make a contribution and you'll get a better seat.
Bow to Leper Messiah.
Marvel at his tricks, need your Sunday fix.
Blind devotion came, rotting your brain Chain, chain, join the endless chain.
Taken by his glamour: Fame, fame.
Infection is the game, stinking drunk with power. We see.
Bow to Leper Messiah. Witchery, weakening, sees the sheep are gathering.
Set the trap, hypnotize; now you follow.

# Damage, Inc.
Dealing out the agony within, charging hard and no one's gonna give in.
Living on your knees, conformity, or dying on your feet for honesty.
Inbred, our bodies work as one: Bloody, but never cry submission.
Following our instinct not a trend, go against the grain until the end.
Blood will follow blood.
Dying time is here! Damage, Incorporated.
Slamming through, don't fuck with razorback.
Stepping out? You'll feel our hell on your back.
Blood follows blood, and we make sure life ain't for you and we're the cure.
Honesty is my only excuse.
Try to rob us of it, but it's no use. Steamroller action crushing all.
Victim is your name and you shall fall
We chew and spit you out. We laugh, you scream and shout
All flee, with fear you run. You'll know just where we come from.
Damage jackals ripping right through you. Sight and smell of this: It gets me goin'.
Know just how to get just what we want, tear it from your soul in nightly hunt.
Fuck it all and fucking no regrets. Never happy ending on these dark sets.
All's fair for Damage Inc., you see. Step a little closer, if you please.

# Blackened
Blackened is the end. Winter it will send, throwing all you see into obscurity.
Death of Mother Earth, never a rebirth. Evolution’s end, never will it mend.
Fire! To begin whipping dance of the dead, blackened is the end.
To begin whipping dance of the dead, color our world blackened.
Blistering of earth, terminate its worth!
Deadly nicotine kills what might have been.
Callous frigid chill: Nothing left to kill.
Never seen before, breathing nevermore.
Opposition, contradiction, premonition, compromise.
Agitation, violation, mutilation, planet dies.
Darkest color: Blistered earth, true death of life.
Termination, expiration, cancellation. Human race.
Expectation, liberation, population, lay to waste.
See our mother put to death; see our mother die.
Smoldering decay! Take her breath away. 
Millions of our years in minutes disappears.
Darkening in vain, decadence remains.
All is said and done; never is the sun. Never.
Fire is the outcome of hypocrisy, darkest potency in the exit of humanity.
Color our world blackened, blackened.

# ...And Justice For All
Halls of justice painted green: money talking.
Power wolves beset your door, hear them stalking?
Soon you’ll please their appetite.
They devour, Hammer of Justice crushes you, overpower.
The ultimate in vanity, exploiting their supremacy
I can’t believe the things you say.
I can’t believe, I can’t believe the price you pay.
Nothing can save you. Justice is lost, Justice is raped, Justice is gone.
Pulling your strings, justice is done.
Seeking no truth, winning is all. Find it so grim, so true, so real.
Apathy their stepping stone, so unfeeling.
Hidden deep animosity, so deceiving.
Through your eyes their light burns.
Hoping to find Inquisition, sinking you with prying minds.
Lady Justice has been raped, truth assassin.
Rolls of red tape seal your lips.
Now you’re done in. Their money tips her scales again.
Make your deal. Just what is truth? I cannot tell, cannot feel.

# Eye Of The Beholder
Do you see what I see?
Truth is an offence: Your silence for your confidence.
Do you hear what I hear? Doors are slamming shut.
Limit your imagination, keep you where they must.
Do you feel what I feel? Bittering distress.
Who decides what you express? Do you take what I take?
Endurance is the word, moving back instead of forward seems to me absurd.
Doesn’t matter what you see, or into it what you read.
You can do it your own way, if it’s done just how I say.
Independence limited. Freedom of choice, choice is made for you, my friend.
Freedom of speech? Speech is words that they will bend.
Freedom with their exception.
Do you fear what I fear? Living properly, truths to you are lies to me.
Do you choose what I choose?
More alternatives: energy derives from both the plus and negative.
Do you need what I need? Boundaries overthrown, look inside. To each his own.
Do you trust what I trust? Me, myself, and I.
Penetrate the smoke screen! I see through the selfish lie.
Do you know what I know?
Your money and your wealth, your silence just to hear yourself.
Do you want what I want? Desire not a thing.
I hunger after independence, lengthen freedom’s ring.

# One
I can’t remember anything, can’t tell if this is true or a dream.
Deep down inside I feel, to scream! This terrible silence stops me.
Now that the war is through with me, I’m waking up. I cannot see.
That there’s not much left of me, nothing is real but pain now.
Hold my breath as I wish for death. Oh please, God, wake me.
Back in the womb, it’s much too real. In pumps life that I must feel
But can’t look forward to reveal: Look to the time when I’ll live.
Fed through the tube that sticks in me, just like a wartime novelty.
Tied to machines that make me be: Cut this life off from me!
Now the world is gone, I’m just one. Oh God, help me! Oh please! God, help me.
Darkness imprisoning me, all that I see: absolute horror.
I cannot live, I cannot die. Trapped in myself: body my holding cell.
Landmine has taken my sight, taken my speech, taken my hearing.
Taken my arms! Taken my legs! Taken my soul! Left me with life in hell.

# The Shortest Straw
Suspicion is your name, your honesty to blame, put dignity to shame. Dishonor.
Witchhunt, modern day determining decay. The blatant disarray: Disfigure.
The public eye’s disgrace defying common place, unending paper chase, unending.
Deafening. Painstaking. Reckoning. This vertigo it doth bring.
Shortest straw. Challenge liberty, downed by law. Live in infamy, rub you raw.
Witchhunt riding through, shortest straw. The shortest straw has been pulled for you.
Pulled for you, shortest straw. Pulled for you, shortest straw.
Pulled for you, shortest straw. The shortest straw has been pulled for you.
The accusations fly. Discrimination, why? Your inner self to die, intruding.
Doubt sunk itself in you, its teeth and talons through, you’re living Catch-22.
Deluding: A mass hysteria, a megalomania, reveal dementia. Reveal.
Secretly, silently, certainly, in vertigo you will be.
Behind you, hands are tied. Your being ostracized, your hell is multiplied.
Upending, the fallout has begun.
Oppressive damage done, your many turned to none, to nothing.
You’re reaching your nadir, your will has disappeared.
The lie is crystal clear: Defending.
Channels red, one word said: Blacklisted. With vertigo make you dead.

# Harvester Of Sorrow
My life suffocates, planting seeds of hate.
I’ve loved, turned to hate. Trapped far beyond my fate.
I give, you take this life that I forsake.
Been cheated of my youth—you turned this lie to truth.
Anger. Misery. You’ll suffer unto me.
Harvester of sorrow, language of the mad.
Pure black, looking clear. My work is done soon here.
Try getting back to me, get back which used to be.
Drink up. Shoot in. Let the beatings begin.
Distributor of pain: Your loss becomes my gain.
All have said their prayers; invade their nightmares.
To see into my eyes, you’ll find where murder lies: Infanticide.

# The Frayed Ends Of Sanity
Never hunger, never prosper, I have fallen prey to failure.
Struggle within, triggered again.
Now the candle burns at both ends. Twisting under schizophrenia, falling deep into dementia.
Old habits reappear, fighting the fear of fear.
Growing conspiracy: Everyone’s after me.
Frayed ends of sanity, hear them calling. Hear them calling me.
Birth of terror, death of much more. I’m the slave of fear, my captor.
Never warnings, spreading its wings as I wait for the horror she brings.
Loss of interest, question, wonder. Waves of fear they pull me under.
Into ruin I am sinking, hostage of this nameless feeling.
Hell is set free. Flooded I’ll be, feel the undertow inside me.
Height, hell, time, haste, terror, tension. Life, death, want, waste, mass depression.

# To Live Is To Die
When a man lies he murders some part of the world.
These are the pale deaths which men miscall their lives.
All this I cannot bear to witness any longer: Cannot the kingdom of salvation take me home?

# Dyers Eve
Dear Mother, dear Father, what is this hell you have put me through?
Believer/deceiver: Day in, day out, live my life through you.
Pushed onto me what’s wrong or right, hidden from this thing that they call life.
Dear Mother, dear Father, every thought I’d think you’d disapprove.
Curator/dictator: Always censoring my every move.
Children are seen but are not heard. Tear out everything inspired.
Innocence torn from me without your shelter. Barred reality, I’m living blindly.
Dear Mother, dear Father, time has frozen still what’s left to be.
Hear nothing, say nothing.
Cannot face the fact, I think for me, no guarantee.
It’s life as is, but damn you for not giving me my chance.
Dear Mother, dear Father, you’ve clipped my wings before I learned to fly.
Unspoiled, unspoken, I’ve outgrown that fucking lullaby.
Same thing I’ve always heard from you: Do as I say, not as I do.
I’m in hell without you. Cannot cope without you two
Shocked at the world that I see, innocent victim. Please rescue me.
Dear Mother, dear Father, hidden in your world you’ve made for me, I’m seething.
I’m bleeding, ripping wounds in me that never heal.
Undying spite I feel for you, living out this hell you always knew.
